## Setting Up the Project

### Initialization


Follow these steps when you first start working on the project, or anytime you want to reset your local development environment:


**Note: Please wait until each command finishes before running the next. Expect long wait times. We recommend keeping your laptop (if you're using one) plugged in during this setup.**


1. Open a terminal and go to the project folder.


2. Run the these commands in the terminal:


    ```
    bin/init
    docker compose up
    ```


    Wait until messages stop scrolling by; the final message will probably be a message from node saying "Starting 'watch-sass' ..."


3. Open your browser and go to `localhost` (no port number needed). Initially, this will show an empty Drupal site.
**Note:** You should see logging messages in the terminal as the sote loads. This may take a minute.

### Database Setup


Once you finish the previous section, follow these steps to set up your USAgov database:


1. Download the latest SQL database available from [our Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zVDr7dxzIa3tPsdxCb0FOXNvIFz96dNx?usp=sharing).


2. Unzip the file and move the .sql file directly into the **root** of your USAgov project folder.


3. Open a new terminal and go to your USAgov project folder.


4. Run one of the following commands to populate the database from the SQL file you downloaded:

    If you sql file is titled `usagov.sql`, run this command:
    ```
    bin/db-update
    ```

    If the file is not titled usagov.sql, run this command:
    ```
    bin/db-update usagov_other.sql
    ```

    **Note:** Expect a message saying there's no need to update the mariadb database.

5. Reload the `localhost` page in your browser. You should now see the beta.usa.gov home page.

### Media files Setup


Once you finish the previous section, you may not see the images on the site, please follow these steps to set up the media files:


1. Download the latest ZIP file available from [our Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tI4k5qasEtmhxCBuznR3t0fe466milYk?usp=sharing).


2. Go to the **root** of your USAgov project folder in your IDE or preferred file manager system in your computer.


3. Locate the following folder: `s3/local/cms/public`.


4. Unzip the downloaded ZIP file and replace the current `s3/local/cms/public` folder with the one you just unzipped.
5. Reload the `localhost` page in your browser. You should now see the images on the site.

### Access the Drupal Portal
If you would like to access the Drupal Portal to make any additional configurations, you will need to follow a few more steps.


1. Generate a new URL to access your administrator account.


    ```
    bin/drush uli
    ```


2. The ***unique*** URL will be in some form of


    `http://default/user/reset/1/123456789/ai6u4-iY1LgZFUjwVW2uXjh5jblqgsfUHGFS_U/login`


    Replace the the `default` portion with `localhost`. It should now be in the form:
    `http://localhost/user/reset/1/123456789/ai6u4-iY1LgZFUjwVW2uXjh5jblqgsfUHGFS_U/login`

    **Note:** This is a ONE-TIME login. You'll automatically be logged in during future uses. However, if you ever reset your container, you will have to redo this process.

3. Adjust your credentials accordingly. You will need a valid username/password combination to provide to the Cypress tests, as well as for logging in to the Drupal portal directly.




### Automated tests setup (cypress)

We use [Cypress](cypress.io). Note that we use only the Cypress App, _not_ Cypress Cloud!

* Tests run in the `cypress` Docker container.
* The tests themselves are in the `automated_tests/e2e-cypress` directory.


## Minimal setup for headless tests

1. Supply *credentials* for the automated tests: Edit the file `env.local.cypress`. Supply a valid user name and password for `cypressCmsUser` and `cypressCmsPass`.

2. Run `docker compose up cypress` to (re-)create the cypress container with the new environment variables.

3. Run `bin/cypress-ssh` to open a shell in the cypress container

   You can run `npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e` to run the entire test suite, or specify a smaller subset like `cypress/e2e/functional`.

Note: The first time you run bin/init, it will create the `env.local.cypress` file by copying `env.default.cypress`. The default `cypressBaseUrl` in that file should be correct for running tests against your local dev site.

## Setup for running Cypress interactively

You will need an X11 server on your computer, so that cypress can open a web browser in an X window you can interact with.

### On MacOS, install XQuartz

This assumes you're using homebrew.

1. Check whether [XQuartz](xquartz.org) is already installed:

   ```
   brew info xquartz
   ```

   If XQuartz is already installed, continue with step 3. If you wind up changing any XQuartz settings, you should restart XQuartz, but you don't need to reboot.

2. If XQuartz is not installed, install it:

   ```
   brew install xquartz
   ```

   XQuartz will start up immediately.

3. From the XQuartz `Settings` menu, select `Security` and check (enable) `Allow connections from network clients`.

   The "network client" you're enabling this for is the virtual machine running in your cypress container.

4. Reboot XQuartz (if you've just installed it).

Proceed to [Allow cypress to open an X window](#allow-cypress-to-open-an-x-window)


### On Windows ... TODO



### Allow cypress to open an X window

You'll need your local IP address. You're looking for the IP address of your machine on your local network, so it will probably start with `10.` or `192.168.`. This command will probably work:

   ```
   LOCAL_IP=$(ifconfig en0 | grep inet | awk '$1=="inet" {print $2}')
   echo $LOCAL_IP
   ```

On a Mac, you can also find your IP Address in your Network Settings, or by holding down the `Option` key and clicking on the Wifi icon in your menu bar.

Note that this address will change if you change networks, or if you disconnect and reconnect to the network

1. Allow connections from your IP address to open X windows:

   ```
   xhost $LOCAL_IP
   ```

   You should see a message like `10.0.0.200 being added to access control list`. (If you see `no DISPLAY is set`, that might mean you didn't reboot after installing XQuartz.)

2. Edit `env.local.cypress`. The `DISPLAY` variable should be set to your local IP address with `:0` after it, for example, `DISPLAY=10.0.0.200:0`

3. Run `docker compose up cypress` to (re-)create the cypress container with the new environment variable. Alternatively, you can set the DISPLAY variable in the shell you get by running `bin/cypress-ssh`.


This setup is based on information from these guides:
* https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/05/02/run-cypress-with-a-single-docker-command#Interactive-mode
* https://sourabhbajaj.com/blog/2017/02/07/gui-applications-docker-mac/

## Theme Lint Guidelines
If you make any changes to the `scss` or `js` files, make sure to check for linting errors nd resolve them before submitting a pull request.


`bin/npm run lint`

## Project Restart/Reset
Sometimes, Docker problems arise after an upgrade and a more complete restart is needed. After closing down and destroying the existing containers, networks, and volumes the procedure is the same as the full project setup.


### Docker Cleanup


```
docker compose down
docker system prune
```


Refer to `Full Project Setup` section above to continue the setup.

## Update Database
Safe development database dumps are kept in Google Drive. You can download and import a SQL database from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zVDr7dxzIa3tPsdxCb0FOXNvIFz96dNx?usp=sharing.


Copy down the database you want by checking the date in the filename. For example: usagov_01_14_2022.sql.zip.
Unzip the file. It should be renamed to just usagov.sql. Place that uncompressed .sql file into the root of your repo. Then call the bin/db-update script. This could take over 10 mßinutes, so be patient. No messages are good. It will return you to the command prompt when it is done.


1. Download and Unzip the respective zip file
2. Move `usagov.sql` to the root of your project directory
3. Run `bin/db-update` (or `bin/db-update usagov_other.sql` if the file is not titled `usagov.sql`)

## Starting on a new ticket
When starting new work you may have to reset your database to a good starting point and make sure the current Drupal config is reflected in the site.


```
# Switch to stable starting point
git checkout dev
git fetch
git pull


# Reset db
bin/db-update
bin/drupal-update
docker compose up


# Start new work
git checkout -b USAGOV-###-new-feature-branch
```


[back to top](#usagov-2021)


## Continuing Work
If you are returning to work on an existing feature branch you will need to make sure to update it with the latest changes from a fresh dev branch. It is also good practice to update any branch you are working on frequently.


```
# switch out of feature branch and into dev branch
git checkout dev
git fetch
git pull


# switch back into feature branch
git checkout USAGOV-###-existing-feature-branch
git merge dev
docker compose up
```

## Tickets and Branching
A branch name must be named after its associated Jira ticket. This is required for some parts of the automation to work. A Branch name must at minumum be USAGOV-###. You may optionally append a short lowercase dash-separated description to make things easier for humans to read.


ex: USAGOV-123-short-ticket-name


If a ticket name is too long, you may shorten or even exclude the title, only the USAGOV-### prefix is required.


We are using a git script to automatically add the current branch name to all commits in an effort to make all commit messages effortlessly reflect the task being worked on. This helps with automation.


```
cp .git.commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

## Single Item Config Export
If you have lots of junk or temporary config changes in your current database you may opt to only pick out the individual configs you know are needed. You can see the full list of available changes on the main Config Synchronize screen (/admin/config/development/configuration). Once you determine which config changes will be needed you can go to the Export > Single Item (/admin/config/development/configuration/single/export). There you can see and export just that one item.

## USAgovTheme
The USAgov theme is a subtheme of the USWDS_base theme.
This project's default start procedure (docker compose up) will start a container to automatically watch for changes and recompile the theme as needed.


The theme can be manually built at any time through gulp's build task. Any other gulp task can be triggered the same way.


```
# Rebuild theme
bin/npm run build
```


Any changes made to the node modules needed for building the theme will require a re-install of the node_modules before build.


```
# Reinstall node modules
bin/npm install
bin/npm run build
```




This theme adds `USWDS_CKEditor_Custom_Styles.scss` into the CKeditor frame.

## Export Database
A helper script has been provided to perform exports.


```
bin/db-export
```


You may specify a filename if you don't want to overwrite the default file location with a new export.


```
bin/db-export other-backup.sql
```


This process asks drush to export the database for us since it does some cleanup work before running the export.

   * Configuration > Development > Configuration Synchronization
   * `/admin/config/development/configuration`
2. Export
   * via Command Line
      a. `bin/drush cex`
   * via Export Full Archive
      a. Export > Full Archive
      b. Move the desired configs into `/config/sync`
   * via Export Single Item
      a. Export > Single Item
      b. Find the config you want to sync
      c. Create/Edit the file in `/config/sync` with the filename shown below the config textbox
      d. Paste the config text into the file

## Build and Deploy procedure
Production ready containers can be built and deployed from a local environment. To do so, proper secrets must be entered into the env.local file as environmental variables. This same procedure is used by CircleCI and is defined in .circleci/config.yml




```
# uses env.local
bin/cloudgov/container-build TAGNAME
bin/cloudgov/container-push TAGNAME
bin/cloudgov/login
bin/cloudgov/space dev
bin/cloudgov/deploy TAGNAME
```

# Troubleshooting


## If cms password is not accepted:
* run `bin/drush uli`
* copy the path of the url onto localhost in your browser's URL bar
* follow the prompts to reset the password


`Dockerfile-node` runs the gulp start command.
