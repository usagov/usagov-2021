# USAGOV WIZARD

## Purpose
Hooks and service to improve Wizard management and customize Wizard display.

### MenuChecker Service

This service returns information about menu entities. If used in conjunction
with preprocess hooks, it can help generate a custom left navigation menu and/or
mobile nav menu comprised of a specific section of a menu. Currently only works for
a taxonomy term page.
