# Much of this module's configuration must be filled from scratch by the
# administrator - or provided in an install routine that sets dynamic values
# for e.g. the SP Entity ID, if new site installation is automated. In the
# latter case, change the 'caching / validity' settings to be production
# defaults. Below values accommodate testing.

# This is TRUE on older installs; FALSE on new installs; doesn't matter much
# if metadata.xml is not reachable to the public.
metadata_cache_http: false
# Not set on older installs; 1 minute on new installs. The default (not set)
# is evaluated to 172800 == 2 days by the SAML Toolkit, so it's probably good
# to set the same (or delete / not set this config value) on production systems.

local_login_saml_error: false

# We will enable some security settings by default, since it is possible but
# not recommended for the module to operate without them. This is a deviation
# from the SAML Toolkit which does not set these values to True by default.

# The following (badly named) option is False by default in the SAML toolkit
# but is causing issues for e.g. ADFS IdPs, and the module maintainer is
# convinced that (unlike other options) noone is harmed by just always having
# it be True.
security_lowercase_url_encoding: true
# The following are True by default in the SAML Toolkit. They have defaults in
# the configuration screen's code to make sure older installs were not affected
# (i.e. values kept being True) when these configuration settings were added.
# So those defaults in code should keep being set for backward compatibility,
# even if we decide to set explicitly set these options to False in this file,
# for new installs. (We may well want to do that for the NameID options, once
# we're sure this has no adverse effects.)
request_set_name_id_policy: true
security_want_name_id: true
# The following option has existed since forever and has not been set to true
# in this file until 3.x-alpha2, even though it is True by default in the SAML
# Toolkit. This means it would flip to False, whenever the configuration screen
# was saved without explicitly checking the checkbox. We'll set it to True for
# new installations.
security_request_authn_context: true
# False on older installs; will be removed (and be 'standard true') in v4.x.
