Admin Content Notification
------------

Description
-----------

Prior to this module, when Drupal users created new content on their Drupal 
site, they had to develop a custom notification informing the site admins about
the added content. It would be through an email notification or a custom code.

Another alternative was to utilize the features of Drupal RULES, which is a 
very huge module and complex to understand.
 
With the introduction of this new Module, users will receive email notifications
whenever a new content of any content type is created or updated on their site.
It has various configuration like : user can configure for which content type 
he want to send notification and for which roles notification should trigger.

they can choose for which content status notification will be send. They can 
also select the roles for which notification will be fired.
