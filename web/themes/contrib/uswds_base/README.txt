INTRODUCTION
------------

uswds_base is a Drupal Theme to utilize the U.S. Web Design System CSS/JS v2
(https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov). This theme is meant to be a little more
stripped down and basic without including any other base, like Classy. This is
in order to allow the designer more control to use only USWDS or add other
items as they individually see fit. *Performed through a uswds_base subtheme.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This theme works out of the box with a CDN, but the USWDS files for v2 should
be loaded on your site. The recommended use of this theme is through creating
a subtheme with either all files in an assets folder or through a sass type
installation.

INSTALLATION
------------

How to use it?

1. Go to admin/appearance/
2. Install and set as default - uswds_base

After review with uswds_base with default CDN, production use should be done
using a custom uswds_base subtheme. Please see starterkits folder for
examples.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * Configure theme settings in Administration » Settings » Uswds_base
(/admin/appearance/settings/uswds_base)
