      We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade
      and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are
      hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our
      energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to
      accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win,
      and the others, too.
