If we are successful at getting NR to work through the egress proxy,
at some point we will need to:

* Remove .docker/Dockerfile-newrelic


Existing NR stuff:

- scripts/bootstrap.sh: look for "Setting up New Relic": updates /etc/php81/conf.d/newrelic.ini
- bin/src/newrelic.sh: Copied and run during CMS image build to install and (partially?) configure NR
     (see .docker/Dockerfile-cms)
