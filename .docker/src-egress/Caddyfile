# TODO
# - For staging/prod:
#   - Document how to tunnel sftp://
#   - Document how to test with cf ssh port-forwarding to your browser!
# - For development:
#   - Document how to test with cf ssh port-forwarding to your browser!
#   	- Add test Dockerfile/directory to compose, similar to what Aaron did for Logstash
#   	- curl tests could also just run in the container, and reference localhost
#   	- Then run with `docker-compose exec caddy test``
