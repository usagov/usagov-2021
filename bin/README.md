# USAgov 2021 Control Scripts

Controls are divided into four parts: local control (base of the bin directory), cloudgov control (cloudgov directory), deployment control (deploy directory), and snapshot controls (snapshot-backups directory).

Additional scripts are found in the scripts directory which are used by the container at runtime.
