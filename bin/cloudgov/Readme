## Spaces

Cloud.gov calls application environments "Spaces." Each developer should have access to four space: a personal Space and one Space each for Dev, UAT, and Prod.

## Dashboard

To view running resources in your available spaces go to this url.

https://dashboard.fr.cloud.gov/

## Command line

All repo interaction with CloudGov happens with the CloudFoundry Client (cf) via the command line.
To be able to run commands targetted toward a CloudGov Space you must be logged in.

```
cf login -a api.fr.cloud.gov --sso
```

Most actions a developer would want to perform will be built into a script placed in the /bin directory of the repo. Actions targetted towards the local environemnt will live direction in the /bin dir, actions targetted towards the hosted CloudGov environments will live in the the /bin/cloudgov directory.

This command can be used to see which space you are currently targeting:

```
cf target
```

This command can be user to switch between spaces:

```
cf target -o <NEW_ORG> -s <NEW_SPACE>
```
