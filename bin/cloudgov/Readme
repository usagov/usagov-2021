## Spaces

Cloud.gov calls application environments Spaces. Each developer should have access to four space: a personal Space and one Space each for the Dev, Stage, and Prod environments.

## Dashboard

To view running resources in your available spaces go to this url.

https://dashboard.fr.cloud.gov/

## Command line

All interaction with CloudGov happens with the CloudFoundry Client (cf) via the command line.
To be able to run commands targetted toward a CloudGov Space you must be logged in. Run this command and follow the instructions:

```
bin/cloudgov/login
```

Most actions a developer would want to perform will be built into a script placed in the /bin directory of the repo. Actions targetted towards the local environemnt will live direction in the /bin dir, actions targetted towards the hosted CloudGov environments will live in the the /bin/cloudgov directory.

This command can be used to see which space you are currently targeting:

```
bin/cloudgov/space
```

This command can be user to switch between spaces:

```
bin/cloudgov/space personal
bin/cloudgov/space dev
bin/cloudgov/space stage
bin/cloudgov/space prod
bin/cloudgov/space shared-egress
```

All subsequent commands will be targetted towards the choosen space

### Build/Deploy

The process of deploying this application to a hosted environmnet is comprised of three steps:
1. Building the Container representing a release of the application (bin/cloudgov/container-build)
2. Pushing the container to a Docker Hub location that can be accessed by CloudGov (bin/cloudgov/container-push)
3. Deploying the CloudGov App based on the Container (bin/cloudgov/deploy)
